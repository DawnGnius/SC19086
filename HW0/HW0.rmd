# Question
We are asked to write a R markdown file to show at least 3 examples presented in the book " R for beginners", such like texts, tables, or figures.


# Answer

## Text

```{r}
text <- "Double quotes \" delimitate Râ€™s strings."
print(text)
```
A string is defined as object "text", and printed via the second line.

## Figure

```{r}
set.seed(1111)
dat <- rnorm(1000, 2, 3)
hist(dat, breaks = 30)
```

$dat$ is 1000 random numbers obeying normal distribution, whose mean is $2$, and variance is $3$. Then the histogram of $dat$ is plotted. 

## Table
```{r}
data("pressure");
names(pressure)
knitr::kable(pressure)
```
