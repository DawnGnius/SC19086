## Question 1 (6.5)
Suppose a $95\%$ symmetric t-interval is applied to estimate a mean, but the sample data are non-normal. 
Then the probability that the confidence interval covers the mean is not necessarily equal to $0.95$. 
Use a Monte Carlo experiment to estimate the coverage probability of the t-interval for random samples of $\chi^2(2)$ data with sample size $n = 20$. 
Compare your $t$-interval results with the simulation results in Example 6.4. 
(The t-interval should be more robust to departures from normality than the interval for variance.) 

## Question 2 (6.6)
Estimate the $0.025, 0.05, 0.95$, and $0.975$ quantiles of the skewness \sqrt{b_1} under normality by a Monte Carlo experiment. 
Compute the standard error of the estimates from (2.14) using the normal approximation for the density (with exact variance formula). 
Compare the estimated quantiles with the quantiles of the large sample approximation $\sqrt{b_1} â‰ˆ N(0, 6/n)$.
